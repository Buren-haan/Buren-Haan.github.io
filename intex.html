            The Internet is built on a layered model where each layer provides services to the one above it. At the foundation lies the physical layer, which includes cables, fiber optics, and wireless signals that transmit raw data. On top of that, the network layer, most commonly represented by the Internet Protocol (IP), is responsible for addressing and routing packets across global networks. Protocols like TCP and UDP in the transport layer ensure reliable or fast delivery of data, depending on the application.
 Fundamental technologies such as DNS (Domain Name System) translate human-readable domain names into IP addresses, while HTTP/HTTPS enables communication between web browsers and servers. Concepts like bandwidth, latency, and packet switching define how efficiently data moves across the Internet. Security is also a core part of Internet technology, with encryption standards, firewalls, and authentication methods protecting users from threats.
 Overall, understanding Internet fundamentals means grasping how devices, protocols, and infrastructure interact to create a seamless experience for users worldwide.
